ðŸš€ Project Completed: Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Data Analysis with PySpark on Databricks ðŸš€
Iâ€™m thrilled to share my latest project, where I analyzed the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Dataset (2019) sourced from Kaggle using PySpark on Databricks with data stored in an AWS S3 bucket.
Highlights of the Project:
Data Preparation: Converted the dataset from CSV to Parquet format for faster analysis and improved performance.
Data Cleaning: Processed the data to remove unnecessary columns and handle missing values, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis.
SQL Analysis: Leveraged SQL on Databricks to perform insightful analyses, including:
Distribution of restaurant ratings across various areas in Bangalore.
Impact of online orders and table bookings on restaurant performance.
Cost analysis for dining across different locations in the city.
Identification of popular cuisines and restaurant types.
This project not only enhanced my technical skills in data engineering, data cleaning, and data analysis, but also reaffirmed my belief in the power of learning in public. Sharing my journey encourages accountability, fosters community, and creates opportunities for feedback and growth.
Excited to continue exploring the vast potential of data and looking forward to more projects in the future! Zomato ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š
